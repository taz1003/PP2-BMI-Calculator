error 1 : had to add (id = "calculate-button") to make sure the eventListener for the calculate button worked. Wasnt working with just class name.
Wasnt able to get BMI value, was getting NaN. Fixed it after some research on google and youtube. Learned to add arguments to pass them into broader scope.
