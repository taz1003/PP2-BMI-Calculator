All in js -
error 1 : had to add (id = "calculate-button") to make sure the eventListener for the calculate button worked. Wasnt working with just class name. (lines 2-3)
Wasnt able to get BMI value, was getting NaN. Fixed it after some research online. Learned to add arguments to pass them into broader scope. (line 41)
During the form validation, the code was continuing even after the first alert message. Added "return" to ensure the discontinuation. (lines 19-31)
Code on lines 68 - 72 was created after a good amount research on youtube.
The for..of loop in lines 79 - 84 was created after similar research on google and youtube.
